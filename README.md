# The-Summit
Open source foldout key holder made designed for FFF in Autodesk Fusion

Keychains are bulky and ugly looking, make a lot of noise and can damage other stuff in your pocket.
Swiss Army knife-style key holders exist but like a good wallet they cost a premium.
Enter The Summit: A free, open-source key holder you can download, print, modify and gift to friends (or sell for that matter, it's WTF licensed so who cares?)

## Inspiration
This project is inspired quite heavily by [The Ridge keyring (get it?)](https://ridgewallet.eu/collections/keycase) but instead of premium, pricey, pristine machined aluminum you can make it out of petty PLA plastic (or even nifty Nylon, if you like)
Similar 3d printed projects do exist, I've been using [this one](ihttps://www.printables.com/model/159941) for quite a while now but the opposing sides and thin ring haven't been very good.
